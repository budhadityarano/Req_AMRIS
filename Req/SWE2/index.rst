   software_architecture

**Purpose:** Define the software architecture for the ABS ECU, decomposing the software
into modules, defining their responsibilities and interfaces.

**Work Products:**

- Software Architecture Specification (SW_ARCH_001 – SW_ARCH_005)
- PlantUML Software Component Diagrams (see ``diagrams/`` folder)

**Traceability:** All software architecture elements refine system architecture from
:ref:`sys3_system_architecture` and address software requirements from
:ref:`swe1_software_requirements`.

**ASPICE Base Practice Reference:** SWE.2.BP1 – Develop software architectural design
