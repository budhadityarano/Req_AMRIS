BPS --> ECU : brake pressure signal
WSS_FL --> ECU : wheel speed pulse (12V, ~1kHz)
WSS_FR --> ECU : wheel speed pulse (12V, ~1kHz)
WSS_RL --> ECU : wheel speed pulse (12V, ~1kHz)
WSS_RR --> ECU : wheel speed pulse (12V, ~1kHz)
ECU --> HCU : solenoid valve commands (4 inlet + 4 outlet)
ECU --> HCU : pump motor PWM control
ECU --> LAMP : fault indication (12V digital)
ECU <--> CAN : wheel speeds, ABS status, diagnostics
HCU --> BRK_FL : hydraulic pressure
HCU --> BRK_FR : hydraulic pressure
HCU --> BRK_RL : hydraulic pressure
HCU --> BRK_RR : hydraulic pressure
