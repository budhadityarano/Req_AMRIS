**Purpose:** Define the high-level system architecture of the Anti-Lock Braking System,
decomposing the system into functional components and defining interfaces between them.

**Work Products:**

- System Architecture Specification (SYS_ARCH_001 – SYS_ARCH_005)
- PlantUML Component Diagrams (see ``diagrams/`` folder)

**Traceability:** All architecture elements derive from system requirements in
:ref:`sys2_system_requirements`.
